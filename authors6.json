The APMAC protocol involves association, data transmission and dissociation phases. Moreover, the APMAC protocol exploits features of the IEEE 802.15. 7 visible light communication (VLC) standard. While assigning bandwidth to the visible light nodes (VLNs), the visible light access point (VLAP) establishes a polling table that contains the identity, buffer size and round-trip time of each VLN that issued bandwidth request. The contents of the polling table enable the computation of the maximum transmission unit and time-slot for each VLN that requests bandwidth assignment.

Protocols translate these metrics into one cost, and than route data. Our simulation tool uses a metric provided by the user. One can add, delete or change nodes, costs in a simulation. Also, we can save the topology of a simulation as a simulation file. We can see the results of a simulation, such as shortest path of all nodes to the other nodes.

Mapper nodes compute a similarity number for each position of each image pair. The reducer node finds out the best stitching position for each image pair by using corresponding similarity values provided by the mappers.

To estimate the most suitable synchronization time intervals, the measured RTT values are included into these classes with an algorithm similar to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Additive-Increase/Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) feedback control.

The motivation of the study is to reveal the impact of semantic knowledge in the topic model researches. Therefore, in a given corpus, different documents may contain different words but may speak about the same topic. For such documents to be correctly identified, the feature space of the documents must be elaborated with more powerful features.

From the test results obtained, it is observed that WNN architecture generalizes well and the activation function suggested has approximately the same success rate with the wavelet function defined in the literature.

The results are presented in comparison with the previous studies conducted to model campus networks. At the same time, the most generic distributions that model the daily incoming/outgoing traffic of the network are identified. The distribution that best models the transmission times of the network packets was identified to be the lognormal distribution for TCP packets and the Generalized Pareto distribution for UDP packets.

More accurate determination of these coupling constants is needed to better understand the strong interactions among the participated mesons, construct the strong potentials among them and get knowledge about the nature and structure of the encountered particles. Experimentally, it is believed that in the production of the charmonium states like J/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 from the Bc or newly discovered charmonium X, Y and Z states by BABAR and BELLE collaborations there are intermediate two body states containing mesons D, Ds, D\u2217 and D\u2217 s mesons (for example, the kaon can annihilate the charmonium in a nuclear medium to give D and Ds mesons), which decay to the final J/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 states exchanging one or more virtual mesons. The similar story would happen in decays of heavy bottonium. To exact follow and analyze the procedure in the experiment, we need to have knowledge about the coupling constants among involving particles. The strong coupling constants among mesons take place in a region of energy very low from the perturbative region and the fundamental QCD Lagrangian has nothing to do. Hence in hadronic scale, one should consult to some nonperturbative methods in QCD to describe nonperturbative phenomena. Among the nonperturbative methods, the QCD sum rules approach [1\u20133] is one of the most powerful, applicable and attractive one as it is based on QCD Lagrangian and is free of model dependent parameter.

The chaotic nature of the underwater environment makes it difficult to transmit data from the source to the receiver. Low frequencies are preferred in underwater communication studies because the systems designed to operate at high frequencies cannot be transmitted to long distances at high frequencies and have limited bandwidth. Communication between two points directly affects bandwidth, source transmission power, and source-receiver distance. In the environment where the communication will be carried out, the signals emitted from the source are received as multi-way in the sensor.

In the web application part, a large data set is first filtered via linear matching in which the color content of the medium and user-defined parameters received from the mobile application are matched to those for the products stored in the database. We then apply second-stage filtering, namely collaborative filtering, on the reduced data set. Performance evaluations of various color quantization methods and collaborative filtering methods used in the system are made.

Accurate location detection is a vital process for most of location-based applications such as emergency rescue, in-building guidance, security services, and product tracking in hospitals. This paper addresses localization of student/teacher tablets and school level proxy servers for educational data synchronization. For this purpose, locations of proxy servers and tablets are detected using Android Location API. After localization, if tablets are outside of school, they could access cloud server directly to get educational data and if tablets are in school, they could access data via proxy server. Experimental results show that the proposed technique increases the efficiency in data transfers between the end users and cloud servers."}, {"author_pub_id": "36CPx9sAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "title": "Dok\u00fcman Tabanl\u0131 NoSQL Veritabanlar\u0131: MongoDB ve CouchDB yatay \u00f6l\u00e7eklenebilirlik kar\u015f\u0131la\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131", "abstract": "\u00d6z\u2013MySQL, Oracle ve Microsoft SQL Server gibi klasik ili\u015fkisel veritaban\u0131 y\u00f6netim sistemleri (VTYS) uzun zamand\u0131r bir\u00e7ok uygulamada veri depolamak ve i\u015flemek i\u00e7in kullan\u0131lmaktad\u0131r.

Treating the diseases seen in trees in time and without any damage to the fruit process is of great importance for efficiency. In particular, it has been seen that problems arising from communication and complex data are facilitated by analysis on computer applications. In this study, geographical information systems (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) have been shown can be used in agriculture. Walnut seedlings planted on 350 thousand hectares of land in Kula district of Manisa are recorded as spatial data in NCZ file system in order to represent geometric points of each seedling. Spatial data was drawn on the Android device using Mapsoft program and the association of the agricultural data with a second database was made. Agricultural data are determined as tree age, weight, daily operations, diseases and deficiencies. Every tree in which farmers are cared for in the agricultural region is recorded as point data in the system. The first recording was made with devices that have Android operating system with sensitive internal GPS. With this device, when the tree query and data entry are made, the GPS location and the nearest tree can be found and the changes can be transferred to the system."}, {"author_pub_id": "VgS9z-sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "title": "PROBLEMS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON USING A RESTRICTED COMPUTER ENVIRONMENT FOR EXAMS ON MOODLE.", "abstract": "A face-to-face learning can be used with the electronic assignments and exam on restricted computer lab environment can be stated as a good example of blended course.

A robot mechanic designed to take the load is needed for these boxes, which have a maximum weight of 300 kg, to be transported autonomously in the factory environment. In industrial mobile robots designed for the textile industry, it is important to approach the target with minimum error before making a precise approach to the target. Causes of approach errors can be physical and/or software. This study includes the method for the development of the differential driving type AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) guided by natural navigation, which will be used to transport the finished products and materials in the factory environment in the textile industry, and the detection of the approach errors of the robot to the target. It proposes a working method to find the causes of the approximation error amount by comparing them in the simulation environment and the real environment.

Moreover, considering the high temperature, humidity, rain, snow and harsh environmental conditions, wireless data transfer provides a big advantage over the wired transfer. In this study, an online software system has been developed for sending the data such as voltage, current, radiation, temperature, and humidity obtained from an installed 1000W PV system via the Bluetooth. A website has been designed for monitoring the data online. Software compatible with both Bluetooth 2.1 and 4.0 standards, which runs on Raspberry Pi, collects the electrical measurement data of PV panels that was placed at various locations.

Both algorithms use hierarchical tree structures (such as Octree for 3D simulations) for clustering particles and concentrate on influence of a cluster instead of influence of each particle in the cluster. In this study, we implement Barnes-Hut, Fast Multipole Method and brute-force algorithms and compare their performance in terms of running-time and accuracy. We observed that although theoretical running-time of Barnes-Hut algorithm is inferior, it provides better performance even for 1 million particles. We also examined the effect of various parameters such as teta, p and maximum number of particles in a leaf on the performance of each algorithm.

The constant velocity model based Kalman filtering is executed on the global motion vectors to obtain smoothed frame positions.

This parser is an inefficient solution for applications which need web content extraction between tags. Therefore, we develop a lightweight parser, namely SET Parser, which is utilized regular expressions and string functions for extracting these tags. In experiments, 2000 web pages are crawled from Sabah and Milliyet for experimental setup. The average size of a DOM tree created from these web pages is as large as 9.58 times of the average size of the web pages. On the other hand, SET Parser in parsing contents is less time consuming than DOM.

It is a preprocessing step of several machine learning and data mining algorithms and the quality of discretization may drastically affect the performance of these algorithms. In this study we propose a discretization algorithm, namely line fitting-based discretization (lFIT), based on the Ramer--Douglas--Peucker algorithm. It is a static, univariate, unsupervised, splitting-based, global, and incremental discretization method where intervals are determined based on the Ramer--Douglas--Peucker algorithm and the quality of partitioning is assessed based on the standard error of the estimate. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a set of experiments are conducted on ten benchmark datasets and the achieved results are compared to those obtained by eight state-of-the-art discretization methods. Experimental results show that lFIT achieves higher predictive accuracy and produces less number of inconsistency while it generates larger number of intervals. The obtained results are also validated through Friedman's test and Holm's post hoc test which revealed the fact that lFIT produces discretization schemes that statistically comply both with supervised and unsupervised discretization methods."}, {"author_pub_id": "rLCDdicAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "title": "Comparison of Querying Performance of Neo4j on Graph and Hyper-graph Data Model.", "abstract": "Graph databases are gaining wide use as they provide flexible mechanisms to model real world entities and the relationships among them.

In parallel with these developments, with the development of material and sensor technologies, these technologies have become feasible. Thus, the studies for transmitting data at high bandwidths and long distances in the underwater environment have increased. The chaotic nature of the underwater environment makes it difficult to transmit data from the source to the receiver. Low frequencies are preferred in underwater communication studies because the systems designed to operate at high frequencies cannot be transmitted to long distances at high frequencies and have limited bandwidth. Communication between two points directly affects bandwidth, source transmission power, and source-receiver distance. In the environment where the communication will be carried out, the signals emitted from the source are received as multi-way in the sensor. Especially reflections from the surface and bottom cause the signals received in the sensor to be distorted.

Experimental results show that lFIT achieves higher predictive accuracy and produces less number of inconsistency while it generates larger number of intervals.
