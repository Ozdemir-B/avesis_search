       "   'abstract': 'Designing block ciphers targeting resource constrained 8-bit CPUs is a challenging problem. There are many recent lightweight ciphers designed for better performance in hardware. On the other hand, most software efficient lightweight ciphers either lack a security proof or have a low security margin. To fill the gap, we present RoadRunneR which is an efficient block cipher in 8-bit software, and its security is provable against differential and linear attacks. RoadRunneR has lowest code size in Atmel’s ATtiny45, except NSA’s design SPECK, which has no security proof. Moreover, we propose a new metric for the fair comparison of block ciphers. This metric, called ST/A, is the first metric to use key length as a parameter to rank ciphers of different key length in a fair way. By using ST/A and other metrics in the literature, we show that RoadRunneR is competitive among existing ciphers on ATtiny45.'},\n",

Therefore, many parameters of the existing or planned networks, such as the requirements, limits and performance are modelled through simulators. Thus, it is possible to save both in terms of time and cost. Campus networks are networks that are established by consolidating many local area networks. The aim of this study is to model campus networks which have a general daily behaviour pattern, through simulators. The data used in the study are collected in real time from Siirt University. The daily behaviour of the network in working hours is divided into four separate time intervals according to the network traffic and in consideration of similar studies in the literature. The most appropriate distributions that model the transmission times of the incoming/outgoing packets at each time zone are identified. The results are presented in comparison with the previous studies conducted to model campus networks. At the same time, the most generic distributions that model the daily incoming/outgoing traffic of the network are identified. The distribution that best models the transmission times of the network packets was identified to be the lognormal distribution for TCP packets and the Generalized Pareto distribution for UDP packets. Compatibility of the distributions was determined through the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-Squared tests.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The strong coupling constants among the bottom and charmed mesons with light scalar, pseudoscalar and axial strange mesons are the main ingredients in analysis of their strong interactions. More accurate determination of these coupling constants is needed to better understand the strong interactions among the participated mesons, construct the strong potentials among them and get knowledge about the nature and structure of the encountered particles. Experimentally, it is believed that in the production of the charmonium states like J/ψ and ψ′ from the Bc or newly discovered charmonium X, Y and Z states by BABAR and BELLE collaborations there are intermediate two body states containing mesons D, Ds, D∗ and D∗ s mesons (for example, the kaon can annihilate the charmonium in a nuclear medium to give D and Ds mesons), which decay to the final J/ψ and ψ′ states exchanging one or more virtual mesons. The similar story would happen in decays of heavy bottonium. To exact follow and analyze the procedure in the experiment, we need to have knowledge about the coupling constants among involving particles. The strong coupling constants among mesons take place in a region of energy very low from the perturbative region and the fundamental QCD Lagrangian has nothing to do. Hence in hadronic scale, one should consult to some nonperturbative methods in QCD to describe nonperturbative phenomena. Among the nonperturbative methods, the QCD sum rules approach [1–3] is one of the most powerful, applicable and attractive one as it is based on QCD Lagrangian and is free of model dependent parameter.

       "   'abstract': 'Advances in communication technologies for the underwater environment have led to the emergence of new underwater acoustic communication techniques. In parallel with these developments, with the development of material and sensor technologies, these technologies have become feasible. Thus, the studies for transmitting data at high bandwidths and long distances in the underwater environment have increased. The chaotic nature of the underwater environment makes it difficult to transmit data from the source to the receiver. Low frequencies are preferred in underwater communication studies because the systems designed to operate at high frequencies cannot be transmitted to long distances at high frequencies and have limited bandwidth. Communication between two points directly affects bandwidth, source transmission power, and source-receiver distance. In the environment where the communication will be carried out, the signals emitted from the source are received as multi-way in the sensor. Especially reflections from the surface and bottom cause the signals received in the sensor to be distorted. In this study, using the transmission loss, absorption loss, and ambient noise models proposed in the literature in the underwater environment, bandwidth, capacity, and transmission power calculations were performed. In calculations, the effects of the different number of multipath signals reaching the receiver from the source, the different dip/surface reflection attenuation to which the multipath signals are exposed, and the distance between the source-receiver on the bandwidth, capacity, and transmission power were analyzed.

hand, most software efficient lightweight ciphers either lack a security proof or have a low security margin. to fill the gap, we present roadrunner which is an efficient block cipher in 8-bit software, and its security is provable against differential and linear attacks. roadrunner has lowest code size in atmel’s attiny45, except nsa’s design speck, which has no security proof. moreover, we propose a new metric for the fair comparison of block ciphers. this metric, called st/a, is the first metric to use key length as a parameter to rank ciphers of different key length in a fair way. by using st/a and other metrics in the literature, we show that roadrunner is competitive among existing ciphers on attiny45.in this paper, two-layered feed forward artificial neural network’s (ann)

comparison with the previous studies conducted to model campus networks. at the same time, the most generic distributions that model the daily incoming/outgoing traffic of the network are identified. the distribution that best models the transmission times of the network packets was identified to be the lognormal distribution for tcp packets and the generalized pareto distribution for udp packets. compatibility of the distributions was determined through the use of kolmogorov-smirnov and chi-squared tests.melanoma is a malignant and aggressive type of skin cancer. this paper describes an

with light scalar, pseudoscalar and axial strange mesons are the main ingredients in analysis of their strong interactions. more accurate determination of these coupling constants is needed to better understand the strong interactions among the participated mesons, construct the strong potentials among them and get knowledge about the nature and structure of the encountered particles. experimentally, it is believed that in the production of the charmonium states like j/ψ and ψ′ from the bc or newly discovered charmonium x, y and z states by babar and belle collaborations there are intermediate two body states containing mesons d, ds, d∗ and d∗ s mesons (for example, the kaon can annihilate the charmonium in a nuclear medium to give d and ds mesons), which decay to the final j/ψ and ψ′ states exchanging one or more virtual mesons. the similar story would happen in decays of heavy bottonium. to exact follow and analyze the procedure in the experiment, we need to have knowledge about the coupling constants among involving particles. the strong coupling constants among mesons take place in a region of energy very low from the perturbative region and the fundamental qcd lagrangian has nothing to do. hence in hadronic scale, one should consult to some nonperturbative methods in qcd to describe nonperturbative phenomena. among the nonperturbative methods, the qcd sum rules approach [1–3] is one of the most powerful, applicable and attractive one as it is based on qcd lagrangian and is free of model dependent parameter. in the present …comparison of space-code

and aluminum oxide contents of vanadium mud samples from seydisehir, turkey. the observed aluminum oxide was used to generate the mathematical relationship.the main purpose is to investigate the boron removal from wastewaters of boric acid and borax. by using boron specific resin amberlite xe 243 : it was shown that the ion exchange operations can be used in removing boron from the wastewaters. in order to compare the results, the solution volume was expressed by dimensionless parameters showing the ratio of the total volume of water v1 subject to ion exchange for a period t1, to the resin volume al. as a result of these trials, it is found that the logarithmic plots of c/co versus v1/v2 appear as straight lines.the ion-exchange method is moderately effective for the removal of boron from solution. boron can be removed by sorption either as h3bo3 or as b(oh)4-.  the equation for the logistic curve provides a means of linearizing the breakthrough curves for ion-exchange columns. either the bed depth service time method or the logit method can be used in evaluating pilot plant results to determine the ion exchange rate coefficient, k, and the ion exchange capacity coefficient, n.vehicle routing problems are a very important subject area used in many sectors. the fact that heuristic and metaheuristic methods, which are mainly used for vehicle routing problem solutions, do not provide an optimum solution, directs new approaches and algorithm development studies. therefore, within the scope of this study, solutions were produced to the time-dependent vehicle routing problem by determining the most suitable routes for the route plan created by applying ant colony optimization together with machine learning algorithms, which is an application of artificial intelligence, by determining the shortest and least costly routes. these solutions were also compared with different datasets and heuristic methods. in the study, an advanced new practical approach is presented to the literature by combining machine learning and ant colony optimization to solve heuristic optimization problems. in addition, this study, in which machine learning and ant colony optimization are used together for the solution of vehicle routing problems, has been brought to the literature with this subject.flexible manufacturing systems have been widely used especially in the field of medicine to develop personal protective types of equipment such as ventilator components or sample collection apparatuses except the face visors and masks/respirators during the fight against the pandemic. in this study, an n95 derivative respirator was designed based on the fdm technology and then compared with similar known mask models in literature in terms of manufacturing costs and functionality. optimization was carried out on printing parameters to improve the speed of manufacturing. finally, all components of the mask were assembled and prepared to be used for medical needs during the pandemic. the cost of the mask and filter components were reduced to 7 ₺ for 2 hours and 32 minutes for each mask. moreover, the durability of each mask was increased three times more than known protective types of equipment to offer longer usage without any fractures caused by daily activities and to have improved airtightness. besides, the mask was designed to have multi-layered filters with the ability of replaceable membranes according to the epidemic agent, and the sterilization procedures were explained. thus, a more economical and healthier protective equipment was created compared to the known respirators in the literature.bilgi teknolojilerindeki gelişmeler eğitim alanında da etkisini göstermiş ve eğitim amaçlı mobil oyunların tasarlanması günümüzde gittikçe

in parallel with these developments, with the development of material and sensor technologies, these technologies have become feasible. thus, the studies for transmitting data at high bandwidths and long distances in the underwater environment have increased. the chaotic nature of the underwater environment makes it difficult to transmit data from the source to the receiver. low frequencies are preferred in underwater communication studies because the systems designed to operate at high frequencies cannot be transmitted to long distances at high frequencies and have limited bandwidth. communication between two points directly affects bandwidth, source transmission power, and source-receiver distance. in the environment where the communication will be carried out, the signals emitted from the source are received as multi-way in the sensor. especially reflections from the surface and bottom cause the signals received in the sensor to be distorted. in this study, using the transmission loss, absorption loss, and ambient noise models proposed in the literature in the underwater environment, bandwidth, capacity, and transmission power calculations were performed. in calculations, the effects of the different number of multipath signals reaching the receiver from the source, the different dip/surface reflection attenuation to which the multipath signals are exposed, and the distance between the source-receiver on the bandwidth, capacity, and transmission power were analyzed. as a …this paper demonstrates implementation of some cdma system compatible antenna array algorithms namely lms and space code correlator (scc) on an fpga. a comparative study of fpga and dsp implementation issues such as architecturecomplexity and weight vector computation time is also given. the implementations of the algorithms are performed on xilinx virtex ii pro fpga and texas instruments (ti) tms32oc67x floating-point dsp platforms. for the signal modeling, cdma2000 reverse link signal model is considered for uniform linear array topology and varying multipath propagation conditions. results show that the both algorithms, which were implemented on xilinx xc2vp4 and tms320c6713 dsp, provides weight vector computation time smaller than 10 ms period.the number of multi-storey building complex is increasing every day. nowadays, widely used in the navigation system’s position in the open space is provided by global positioning satellite system gnss. unfortunately, the direct use of gnss systems in indoor areas is not possible. many technologies in the field of indoor location determination (wireless, rf (radio frequency), bluetooth,...) have been used. this article aims to develop a minimal cost indoor positioning system. the proposed system to avoid the cost (to capture the minimum cost) to rssi (received signal strength indicator) value using the integrated high cost of communication is used. is not very much affected by noise rssi information in the system used in the study. is of vital importance to reduce signal noise projects naturally. kalman filter system for reducing noise signal is added. the adjusted value of the noise signal in the article and the values passed to the kalman filter will be examined and compared.today, in the physical treatment of children; stretching, electrical stimulation, biofeedback, active joint movement, strengthening and cold application are used to complement the child\\'s motor and mental state. children are often forced and bored during these treatments. therefore, the efficiency of the treatment is greatly reduced. in this study, an application that can be used in the treatment of discomfort in the hands and wrists of young children has been developed. with this application, it is aimed to create a virtual play environment for children and to facilitate the treatment process. leap motion technology was used in the development of the application. the application consists of five levels. each level aims to have different finger and wrist movements. operation of the application is provided according to the rules determined in hand and wrist physical therapy. in addition, each level is designed and developed with scenarios that can attract children\\'s attention. in our study, a test group consisting of six-person, three adults and three children, was formed and asked to use the application. usability assessment tests and questionnaires were applied to participants to get their opinions about the game. it has been observed that children can do the exercises necessary for physical therapy of hand and wrist while playing. as a result, it was observed that the participants were pleased to play the game and that the treatment process was made playful thanks to the game, and that the treatment was liked by the children.with the development of technology, the use of real-time location systems has become widespread. for this purpose, it is important to select the most suitable location detection method considering the conditions of the location where the location determination is to be done. in this study, a low-cost job tracking system was developed in order to provide follow-up of workers and working machine. in the developed system, an architecture communicating with rf and gps technologies was designed in order to ensure follow-up of both workers and working machine. the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed architecture has been tested in a factory and has been shown to facilitate job monitoring.this article explains implementing of fast fourier (fft) and inverse fast fourier transform (ifft) algorithms in fpga. the reason of designing the study on fpga base is that fpgas are able to rearrange of logical blocks and moreover, mathematical algorithms can confirm faster by means of parallel data processing. for operating these algorithms, it was used the family of xilinx virtex2p xc2vp30fg676-7 fpga device as a hardware in this study. in programming the hardware and writing codes, vhdl was used. the results show that fft and ifft algorithms result in 0.6 µs and 0.72 µs cycle time respectively.floating point numbers represent a good approximation to real nimbers so that floating point algorithms are frequently used in modern applications that require millions of calculations per second despite their advantages, floating point operations extremeh require much area and time for ordinary implementation. use of higher-level languages on ffg4, such as whdl, facilitates the development of custom operators with high performance i low area and time. in this paper, ve describe a method for the implementation of floating-point arithmetic on field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) using vhdl script language and present the preliminary results of this implementation. ords: fpga, vhdl, floating point arithmeticthe purpose of this thesis is implementing of the ofdm modem architecture on fpga by using ieee-754 floating point and iq-math fixed point number format. two different ofdm modem design implemented by using ieee-754 and iq-math, compared with basis of the usage of fpga hardware resources, design clock frequency and the sensitivity of number formats criteria.field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) provide advantages on hardware applications with on-system reconfigurable features by the execution of digital logic function of the designed logic circuits. vhdl is a very high definition hardware description language described in a text file that is used for the documentation, simulation and synthesis of complex digital design. for fuzzy inference systems, it is possible that speed requirements can be provided by fpgas and flexibility requirements can be met by vhdl. in this study, fpga based fuzzy simulation is implemented for a two input-one output function. fuzzy systems have three modules that are fuzzifier, inference mechanism and defuzzifier modules. fuzzy inference and defuzzifier are realized in the same function. membership degree of inputs is obtained from a rom using table method. center-of-average method is used in defuzzifier module. input and output values are represented by using 32-bit floating point number.'"
